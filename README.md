# MLOps Model Deployment and Interface Comparison

This project explores different approaches to deploying machine learning models using Gradio, Hugging Face, and GitHub Actions. It compares API-based and locally-run model deployments, analyzing their performance, cost, and scalability.

## Project Components

1. API-based product hosted on Hugging Face Spaces
2. Locally executed product hosted on Hugging Face Spaces or local machine
3. GitHub Actions for repository synchronization and automated testing
4. Performance and cost analysis of both deployment approaches
